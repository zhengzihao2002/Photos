CODE WISE

YI photos: admin controller's create and delete user wrote basically independently, and mostly just called zihao's written method (such as delete file related, load scene,etc ) or reuse zihao's code as template。
create OR delete (cannot remember) method zihao step by step told yi how to write in the beginning stage to get yi started。design ui of left side of storyboard. Wrote user list controller independently?

ZIHAO photos: everything else. additionally taught yi from scratch how to use JavaFX (set stages, connect fxml with controller, etc)
